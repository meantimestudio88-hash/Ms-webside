                    <p>We begin by understanding routines, storage patterns, privacy needs, and circulation. How do people move through the space? Where do they work, rest, gather? What needs to be stored, and where?</p>
                    <p>These observations inform every spatial decision. The design is structured around real use, not idealized living.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Spatial organization comes before aesthetic layering. We test proportion, flow, and balance through drawings and models. The framework must work before finishes are selected.</p>
                    <p>Every intervention is measured. Walls are removed or added only where they improve circulation or privacy. Storage is integrated, not added. The spatial structure supports the routines it will house.</p>
